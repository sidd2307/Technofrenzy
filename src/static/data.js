So when you say using "just an array", I would say arrays are the most basic/common data structure that a binary search is employed on. You can do it recursively (easiest) or iteratively. Time complexity of a binary search is O(log N) which is considerably faster than a linear search of checking each element at O(N). Here are some examples from Wikipedia: Binary Search Algorithm:`,
